# React Custom Hook – useFetch

## Description

This project demonstrates how to create and use a **custom React hook** called `useFetch` to fetch data from an external API.  
The hook simplifies API calls by handling loading and error states and returning fetched data in a reusable way.

The project is built using **React with Vite** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
